# What is StargateTech? #
StargateTech is a mod about Stargate technology in Minecraft.
Lots of stuff from the TV Show "Stargate" will be added, but there are some restrictions.
We'll stick to technology only (It's a Tech Mod, after all), no weapons (OverPowered), no mobs (lots of mods do that already) except the Replicators, no Goa'uld stuff (It's just a bad replica of Ancient technology).

# Is there a forum topic where I can read more about it? #
You can read it's Minecraft Forums topic (which is the official one, by the way) right here:

# Is StargateTech Open-Source? #
Yes, it is!

# Can I join the project? #
Sort of. Fork this repository, get some code done (trying to close some issues would be great), and send us a Pull Request.
Pull Requests will be accepted according to some criteria, like code quality and if a new feature fits the mod.
If you're good enough, you'll be asked for commitment with the project. A good knowledge / understanding of the Stargate lore can help you a lot, but it isn't required, as long as you know what you're doing.
